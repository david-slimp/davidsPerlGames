ASCII / curses arcade style games written in Perl

## Initial Inspiration:

My first introduction to computers started back in the 1980s when, as a kid, I enjoyed creating simple ASCII games to keep myself entertained with both the programming and playing aspects.

Back then I was using a Tandy Model 2 computer. Later, as an adult I thought it would be fun to recreate a couple of those games. In the early 2000s my favorite language and one I was teaching classes on, was Perl, and so that is the language I used.

Amazingly enough, one of my games "Perl Defense Blaster" caught the eye of Marcel Gagn√© who was writing articles for Linux Journal magazine, and so I got a few fun paragraphs written about it, with a nice shout-out:  
 [Linux Journal article with PerlDefenseBlaster](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4792#:~:text=Perl%20Defense%20Blaster)

Now, with more code and solutions available online, I thought it would be a good time to add it to GitHub, along with several other projects of mine from over the years.

## Dependencies

Last I looked, it requires the `Curses.pm`, `Term::ReadKey.pm` and `Time::HiRes` Perl modules.

## Installing

These are just simple Perl scripts, so aside from getting those dependencies installed, these scripts just need to be run with:  
`perl PerlDefenseBlast.pl`  
and the like.

## Playing

This collection should have 3 separate games:

- ### Perl Defense Blaster

  **Defend your planet from the alien invasion!**  
  Use the "4" and "6" keys on the number pad to move

- ### Perl Racer
  **Vertical scrolling racing game!**
- ### Perl Arena
  **Kill the mutants!**

## Contribution

In my eyes, these small games are finished, as they are very close to the same look and feel of what I created as a kid in the 80s. However, if we find bugs or efficiency tweaks, there's always room for improvement.
