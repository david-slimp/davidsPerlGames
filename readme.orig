perlblaster is an attempt at creating an ascii arcade stylish game written in perl (as much as possible).

Here at the beginning of its creation I am VERY open to ideas and suggestions on game play, objectives, and anything, really!

You will need to run perlblaster in a terminal window, and for now need to make sure all the game files are in your current directory.  
(I'm sure all this will be more flexible soon)

Also, for best play I recommend you set your terminal size to 80x24.


Feel free to send ideas, suggestions, flames and fixes to me at
